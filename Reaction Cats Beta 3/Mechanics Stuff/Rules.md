Rules
======================
Now, If You Have Collected A Bunch
Of Stuff, Then You Are Ready, Now, Here Are The Rules
To Reaction Cats:
Reaction Cats Is A Turn Based Game, The Characters In It Are Cats, Your 
Cats Battle Against Each Other In Order To Win, Now, First, How To Obtain Cats:
You Start With 1 Basic Cat, When You Go Higher Than A Specific Level
Then Your Cat Evolves To Itself In The Next Rarity.
The Max Levels Before Evolution For Cats:
Basic: 5
Uncommon: 9
Rare: 5
Mega: 10
Ultimate: 15
Epic: 20
Legendary: 30
Mythic: 35
Insane: 45
Supreme: 100
Extreme: 200

Leveling Up
======================
Now, You Might Be Wondering, How Do I Level Up?
Basically, Whenever You Take Out A Cat In A Match,
You Level Up 1 Level, Therefore, It Can Take Time,
Your Cat Gains +5 To All Stats Except Speed When
They Level Up.

How To Play:
======================
This Game Is Played In Turns, Except, Everyone
Has Their Turn At The Same Time, Every Turn, You
Can Throw Down 1 Passive And 1 Active Core:
Cores Are Basically Actions, You Start With
The Move, Attack, Defense, And Draw Cores,
Draw Cores Do Something Special Though, They 
Let You Grab A Charge:
Charges Buff Your Cores, Place The Bundle Of
Charge Things Onto Of The Stack Or Core Things To
Represent A Charge, Charges Can Only Go On Cores
Of Their Type, With Is Said In The File, Also, Put Your
Charge Back In The Place It Came From When You’ve Used It.

Now I Explain Attacks:
======================
Attacks Are A Big Aspect, When You Do An Attack Against An Enemy Cat,
Roll Out This Process:
Compare Speed Values, If The Enemy Has A Bigger Speed Value Then Roll-Off,
Whoever Gets A Higher Result Wins, So If You Win The Roll Off, You Hit,
If The Enemy Wins, They Dodge, Then, If You Hit, Select Your Attack. Then
Modify Everything The Attack Says And Then, With The Modified Attack And
Reduced Enemy Defense, Reduce The Enemys HP By The Modified Attack Value Minus
The Modified Defense Value, Then Set All Stats Back To Normal.

Defense:
======================
Defense Can Defend You From Stuff, However, It Also Heals You,
Every Turn, Your Cat Automatically Heals HP Equal To Half It’s Defense Value.
This Makes Defensive Cats Better And More Balanced.

Stamina:
======================
Cats Have Stamina, It Is The Thing That Makes Your Cat Go,
The Lower Your Stamina Gets, The Weaker Your Cat Gets,
Here Are The Ways You Lose Stamina, It Will Tell You How Much
Stamina That You Lose Each Turn That You Do This Action:
Move At More Than Half Your Max Speed (1 Stamina)
Preform More Than Half Your Max Attacks Per Turn (1 Stamina)
Jumping (1 Stamina)
Flying (2 Stamina)
Now, You Might Be Wondering What Losing Stamina Does.
Basically, Every Point Of Stamina You Lose, Your Speed Value Goes Down By 1,
And If Your Stamina Reaches Half It’s Value, Your Attack Speed Is Reduced By Half,
However, You Can Regenerate Stamina, Here Are The Ways You Can Regenerate Stamina:
Moving At 1 Quarter Or Less Of Your Max Speed
Preforming 1 Or Less Attack A Turn
Every Turn That One Of These Apply’s, You Regenerate 1 Stamina
And Your Speed Value Goes Up By 1 And If Your Stamina Is Over Half
Your Attack Speed Reverts To It’s Original Value.
You Can’t Regenerate More Than Your Max Stamina.

Speed:
======================
Your Speed Helps With Attacks And Determines How Fast
You Move, You Can Move Up To Your Max Speed Value, Witch Is
The Value Of Your Cats Speed Rating, However, Speed Can Affect
Stamina.

Jumping:
======================
Terrain Can Have Multiple Levels, This Means That
Your Cat Can Jump, You Can Jump Up As Many Levels
As Your Jump Value Is Equal To.

HP: 
======================
This Is You Health, If It Reaches 0, Then Your
Took Down, This Means That You Leave The Match
And You Have Lost It, However, You Still Level Up
Depending On The Amount Of Cats You Took Down.
