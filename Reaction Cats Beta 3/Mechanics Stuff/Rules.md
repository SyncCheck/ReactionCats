Rules
======================
Now, If You Have Collected A Bunch
Of Stuff, Then You Are Ready, Now, Here Are The Rules
To Reaction Cats:
Reaction Cats Is A Turn Based Game, The Characters In It Are Cats, Your 
Cats Battle Against Each Other In Order To Win, Now, First, How To Obtain Cats:

If Your Cat Hits The Enemy Cat,
And Succeeds, They Can Attack Again The
Same Turn, If They Hit Again, Then They Do
2X Damage, Every Time That They Hit, They Can
Do Another Attack With The Multiplier Increasing
By 1, So Basically Every Time You Hit, You Can
Do Another Attack With The Damage Going Up By X1 Multiplier,
Also, Every 2 Extra Attacks You Do Beyond You Max Attacks Increases
Your Recharge Time By One Turn, You Can't Switch Targets, It Must All
Be Against One Cat.

Rarity Order:
======================

Epic

Legendary

Mythic

Leveling Up:
======================
Now, You Might Be Wondering, How Do I Level Up?
Basically, Whenever You Take Out A Cat In A Match,
You Level Up 1 Level, Therefore, It Can Take Time,
Your Cat Gains +5 To All Stats Except Speed When
They Level Up.

How To Play:
======================
This Game Is Played In Turns, Except, Everyone
Has Their Turn At The Same Time, Every Turn, You
Can Throw Down 1 Passive And 1 Active Core:
Cores Are Basically Actions, You Start With
The Move, Attack, Defense, And Draw Cores,
Draw Cores Do Something Special Though, They 
Let You Grab A Charge:
Charges Buff Your Cores, Place The Bundle Of
Charge Things Onto Of The Stack Or Core Things To
Represent A Charge, Charges Can Only Go On Cores
Of Their Type, With Is Said In The File, Also, Put Your
Charge Back In The Place It Came From When Youâ€™ve Used It,
The Way It Works Is You And a Friend Dual Each Other In A Match,
In This Match, You Select A Cat You Own, And It Is Explained
Later How To Get Cats And Other Stuff, You Can Also Play This
Game Like An RPG, And Have Missions And GM's,
The Material In This File Is Assorted, You May Have To
Go And Re-Read It A Few Times To Get The Hang Of It,
Anyway, I Will Explain More About Matches Later, If You Stay
Reading The Rules Of The Game...

Now I Explain Attacks:
======================
Attacking Is A Complicated Process, But I Will Explain It:
First, You And Your Enemy Roll Your D6's, Then, Multiply
The Results By Half Of Your Speed Value, Whoever Has The Higher
Value Wins, So If You Have The Higher Value, You Hit, If They Have The
Higher Value, They Dodge, Anyway, Once You've Done That, Select One Of
Your Attacks, Then, Modify Your Attack Value And The Enemy's Defense
Values By It, Then, Roll A D4, Divide The Enemys Modified Defense Value By That,
Round Stuff Up, After That, Subtract The Enemys Modified, Divided, Defense
Value From Your Attack Value, Then You Have Your Final Number, To Apply
The Damage, Roll Accuracy And Apply The Results To Your Attack Value.
This Process May Be Complicated, But It's Efficent And Realistic, And
Once You've Got The Hang Of It, It Should Take 10 Seconds.

Ultimate Customization:
======================
You May Have Noticed The Ultimate
Customization Folder In The Game Stuff
Section, This Is To Customize Cats, Inside
The Folder It Has 1. Ability Modules, And 2. Event Stuff
All Of This Is Buyable Using Customization Points, To Get 1 Customization
Point, Take Down A Cat In A Battle, The Abilitys Have Something
That Says AS, Short For Ability Slots, Cats In Reaction Cats Normally
Have 10 Ability Slots, All The Abilitys That Are On The Base Cat Count As
1 Ability Slot Tooken Up, Different Abilitys In The Customizer Take Up Different
Amounts Of Slots, So Weak Abilitys Usually Take Up 1 Slot, But The Strongest Abilitys
Take Up To 3 Slots, Also Note That You Can 1 Rank In Any Skill Using 1 Point To Put
On The Cat, Finally, These Kinds Of Abilitys Stay On A Cat Through Evolution.

Attack Speed And Recharge:
======================
Basically, You Can Do Your Attack Speed
Number Of Attacks Before You Must Wait Your
Attack Recharge Turns To Do Another Attack,
Note That Every Turn That You Don't Attack
Your Recharge Goes Down By One, So You Can
Recharge When You Still Have Attacks Left,
You Can Not Recharge More Than Your Attack Speed Attacks.

Action Skipping:
======================
Note That Your Cat Doesn't Have To
Do An Action, As You Can Just Skip Instead

Going On Gaurd:
======================
Going On Gaurd Is A Special Thing That A Cat Can
Do, It Takes The Whole Turn To Go On Gaurd, And Once
The Cat Is On Gaurd, They Can't Move, The Cat Decides
If They Want To Stay On Or If They Want To Go Off Gaurd
At The Start Of The Turn, When On Gaurd, The Cat Automatically
Attacks Any Enemy Cat That Walks Past Them, And Can Still Attack
Again That Turn, As It Is A Free Action, Also, Enemy Cats That Pass
The Cat On Gaurd Are Stopped And Can't Move Away From The Cat On Gaurd
For 1 Turn, Their Is One Very Special Thing Gaurd Does, It Makes Your
Attacks Use Your Defense Value In Place Of Your Attack Value, Which Means
That Defense Based Cats Going On Gaurd Is Better Than Attack Based Cats Going
On Gaurd.

Skills And Checks:
======================
Skills Are Special What Your Cat Knows What To Do, From Balance
To Making Things Explode, Their Is No Specific Skillset In Reaction Cats,
You Have Different Skills On Your Cats, Each Cat Starts With No Skills,
But You Can Train Them, Every Rank Of Skill You Go Up, You Get Better At
Doing That Thing, Checks Are Basically What You Do If Your Trying To Preform
A Specific Action, Each Check Has Its DL, This Is The Difficulty Level, When
Preforming A Check, The DL Determines How Hard Is Is, To Preform A Check,
Roll A D20, Then, Add Your Skill To It, And Then Add The Stat, If The Number Is
Equal Or Higher Than The DL Of The Check, You Suceed, If It Is Lower, You Fail.
To Gain More In A Skill, Your Cat Must Level Up. Every Level Your Cat Goes Up Allows It
To Gain 1 Rank In A Certain Skill, Their Is No Max DL, And The Max Skill Level
Is 10, Though That Is Nearly Impossible To Get. This Adds To The RPG Aspect Of Reaction Cats.

Ultimate Evolution:
======================
This Is The Type Of Evolution For The Best Of The Best, It Exceeds
Extreme Rarity, To Get It, And Be Able To Evolve Beyond Extreme,
Their Are 2 Ways To Do It: 1. Get An Ultimate Evolution Token Through
An Event, Tournament, Etc. 2. Have 4 Different Extreme Cats That Are All
At Max Level On Their Type, And These Cats Must Each Be On Different Cats,
So Basically, You Must Have A Max Level Fire, Water, Earth, And Air Cat,
Once You Do That, You Get An Ultimate Evolution Token That Lets You Unlock
This, Type Stuff Does Not Disappear After Your Cat Evolves Beyond Extreme,
The Order The Ultimate Evolution Raritys Go Through Are Infinity, Then Vortex,
Then Void, And Your Max Level Extreme Cats All Evolve To Infinity, Here
Are The Max Levels Before Evolution For These Cats:
Infinity: 125
Vortex: 150
Void: 200
Also, These Cats Have More Than 2 Starting
Abilitys On Them, To Go Past Extreme
Rarity, However, You MUST Have Max Level In
Your Type.

Power Trees:
======================
In The Game Stuff Folder, Their Are Things Called Power
Trees, These Are Specific Special Trees For Cats, Whenever Your
Cat Evolves, Check Your Power Tree To See What You Got, Note
That Things Like Traits Don't Disappear When You Evolve, And Also
Note That The Things That Say 'Pick One:' Let You Pick Which Skill
You Want To Go Up Ranks In.

Effects:
======================
Sometimes, A Cat May Be Effected By An Effect,
These Are Basically Wierd Conditions That May Happened
To A Cat, The Effect Lasts As Many
Turns As The Thing That Applyed 
Them Says It Would Here Are The Current 3:
1. Scared: The Cat Can't Move Towards, Or Attack,
The Thing That Is Scaring, Them, And If The Thing
Is Within Range 3 Of The Cat, The Cat Must Use Their
Next Possible Passive Action To Move Away From It,
2. Frozen: The Cat Can Not Do Anything On Their
Turn Until This Wears Off, On The Plus Side, If
They Are Frozen In Ice, The Ice Block Freezing Them
By Default Has 1000 HP. Normally It Isn't Ice.
3. Fire: The Cat Loses 75% Of Their Defense Value
HP Every Turn, And The Cats Movement Has To Be Random.

Types:
======================
You May Have Noticed The Folder That Says 'Types' In The Game Stuff
Section, Those Are Special Types For Cats, Once Your At Max Level
Extreme Cat Rarity, You Pick One Of Those 4 Types And One Of The Classes
In The Type, Once You Join A Type, Make Sure You Get The Thing From Your Main
Type Main Tree That Costs 0 VP, The Reason It Is VP Is Because Once You
Enter A Type, Count Up All The VP You've Earned With That Cat In That Type
Scince You Joined That Type, Whenever You Get To A Specific Amount Of These
'Type Victory Points' Then You Get Special Feautres, And Of Course, You Also
Obtain Stuff From The Class You Selected In The Type Aswell, Once Your Type Victory
Points Reach 100, Stop Counting Them For That Cat. You Can Switch Types On A Cat, But
You Remove All The Stuff From That Type From The Cat And You Also Reset Your Type
Victory Point Count.

Defense:
======================
Defense Can Defend You From Stuff, However, It Also Heals You,
Every Turn, Your Cat Automatically Heals HP Equal To Half Itâ€™s Defense Value.
This Makes Defensive Cats Better And More Balanced.

Stamina:
======================
Cats Have Stamina, It Is The Thing That Makes Your Cat Go,
The Lower Your Stamina Gets, The Weaker Your Cat Gets,
Here Are The Ways You Lose Stamina, It Will Tell You How Much
Stamina That You Lose Each Turn That You Do This Action:
Move At More Than Half Your Max Speed (1 Stamina),
Jumping (1 Stamina),
Flying (2 Stamina),
Now, You Might Be Wondering What Losing Stamina Does.
Basically, Every Point Of Stamina You Lose, Your Speed Value Goes Down By 1,
And If Your Stamina Reaches Half Itâ€™s Value, Your Speed Is Reduced To Half,
However, You Can Regenerate Stamina, Here Are The Ways You Can Regenerate Stamina:
Moving At 45% Or Less Of Your Max Speed,
Every Turn That One Of These Applyâ€™s, You Regenerate 1 Stamina
And Your Speed Value Goes Up By 1 And If Your Stamina Is Over Half
Your Speed Gets Fixed To What It Was When Not Halfed, But Still Reduced.
You Canâ€™t Regenerate More Than Your Max Stamina.

Matches And How To Win:
======================
This Is How Matches Work:
Basically, You And The Enemy
Pick Hexes For Your Cats To Start
On, After That, Pick 3 Objectives,
If You Have More Than 1 Cat On Each Side
Then Pick Up As Extra As Their Are Cats Beyond
1 On Each Side, These Objectives Give You Victory
Points, Which Is How You Win, Your Goal Is To
Go And Achieve These, They Give You Victory Points,
Note That Both You And Your Opponent Pick The Objectives
For Both Of You, As In You Both Have The Same Objectives To Achive,
If Someone Achieves An Objective, The Other Person Can't
Achieve That Objective Anymore, The Game Ends When
One Person Obtains More Than Half Of The Victory Points
Worth Of All The Objectives,
Victory Points Are How You Win, Objectives
Tell You How Many Victory Points They
Are Worth By Saying 'VP=' And Then A Number, 
This Is How Much Victory Points You Obtain After Achiving
That Objective, Taking Down An Enemy Cat Gives You Only 1
Victory Point, But It Makes Stuff Easier, The Game Also Ends
If 1 Team Has All Their Cats Took-Down, In The End, The Person
Who Won Is The Person Who Has The Most Objectives, So Go
And Achive Those Objectives.

Speed:
======================
Your Speed Helps With Attacks And Determines How Fast
You Move, You Can Move Up To Your Max Speed Value, Witch Is
The Value Of Your Cats Speed Rating, However, Speed Can Affect
Stamina, Cats Can Never Go Below 1 Speed, No Exeptions.

Jumping:
======================
Terrain Can Have Multiple Levels, This Means That
Your Cat Can Jump, You Can Jump Up As Many Levels
As Your Jump Value Is Equal To, Also, You Can Jump Over
Your Jump Value Hexes.

HP: 
======================
This Is You Health, If It Reaches 0, Then Your
Took Down, This Means That You Leave The Match
And You Have Lost It, However, You Still Level Up
Depending On The Amount Of Cats You Took Down.

Abilityâ€™s:
======================
These Are One Of The Most Important Aspects Of The Game,
Basically, They Apply An Effect To The Battle, Also, Some Abilityâ€™s
Say You May Do Something, This Basically Means That You Have A Decision
If You Want To Apply The Effect For The Time It Lasts,
Note That Abilityâ€™s Like Zeusâ€™s Head Sleep Ability Are Only Useable
At Melee Range.

Legacy Cats:
======================
These Are Old Cats From Another Game That I Made That Was Abandoned (Cat Wars),
You Can Win Them From Tournaments.

Vision:
======================

When You Do An Attack, Roll A D12/2 D6 And Add Your Vision Stat
To The Result. And Then Apply That Effect To The Final Result.

1-4: 25% Damage
5-8: 50% Damage

Bumpy Terrain: Cat Moves At 3 Quarters Speeds Through This Type
Regular Terrain: Cat Moves At Normal Speeds Through This Type
Damaging Terrain: Cat Takes Specified Amount Of Damage Every Turn
They Are On This Terrain, This Is Just A Terrain Mod.
Conveyor Belts: Conveyor Belts Are Interesting, When A Cat Stands On It,
They Move Its Speed Amount Hexes Per Turn In The Direction It's In, If The Cat
Moves Along With The Conveyor In It's Direction, Then They Add The Conveyors
Speed To Their Speed Value While Doing This, If The Cat Moves Against The Conveyor
In The Opposite Direction, They Subtract The Conveyors Speed Value From Theirs While
Doing This. Their May Be More Terrain Types Later.
Liquid: The Cat Moves At Half Speed And Can Move Up Or Down Up To 2 Hexes,
If The Cat Is Under The Water, Which Happends If They Move Down 1 Hex,

Ability That Lets Them Travel Normally On Ice.

Walls And Doors:
======================
Their Are Walls And Doors In This Game,

An Active Action To Open, Complex Walls Have Lots
Of HP, Complex Doors Take A Whole Turn To Open, Also,
Their Is Another Thing Called Hypertech, Hypertech Walls Are
Really Hard To Destroy, Hypertech Doors Take 2 Turns To Open.

More About Doors:
======================
When A Cat Opens A Door, It Closes Behind Him By Default,
Unless He Wants To Keep It Open, If A Cat Travels Through The Open
Door They Can Choose To Close It After Traveling Through, Complex And
Hypertech Doors Can Somethimes Be Locked, Which Means That To Unlock
It You Need To Preform A DL 10 Computers Check For Complex Doors,
And A DL 20 Computers To Unlock A Hypertech, Note That By Unlocking
It You Are Not Opening It, Finally, It Is Possible For A Cat To Use A
Passive Action To Lock A Lockable Door From The Side That It Is Lockable,
And It Takes A Passive Action To Unlock The Door If You Know How Like If It
Is For Your Team Base Or If It Is Your Base, And It Is Always A Passive Action To Lock
A Door, And It Can Only Be Locked From The Side That It Is Specified
To Be Lockable.
