Rage Can Be Used For Cool Things.

Using Rage:

1 Way To Use Rage Is For Damage, To Use It This Way

Remove Any Amount Of Rage Points From The Current Amount

That You Have, Then, You May Use Those Points To Deal Extra Damage

(Example:You Spend 10 Rage Points

So Your Attack Then Does +10 Damage).

Another Way To Use Rage Is For Special Rage Attacks And Ability’s (There’s 5),

You Just Discard The Certain Amount Of Rage Points It Requires And Then You

Are Able To Do It Once (They Are Crazy Powerful) Until You Spend Rage To Use It Again.

Rage And CatBux:

This Is A Simple Thing, Every Point Of Rage That’s Unspent By The End Of The Match

Is Added To The Amount Of CatBux You Gain (This Is, Of Course, In Addition To The +10 CatBux

You Get As A Premium).
